# ðŸŒˆ RAINBOW REPORTERS ðŸŒˆ

- database of proteins (should i care about doing collections)
  - some portion will have PDB atomic coordinates. but many will exist just as amino acids
  - how do i handle states? separate records? when you have variations
  - to make life simple just gonna grab the first 1k from FPBase
- viewer of colorpicker
  - color picker RGB <> nm wavelength. gives a sorted list by closeness
  - picking gives you structure w/ analysis charts
- with trained network, output if there's a fluorescence at certain wavelength/brightness


pipelines (going to use same db for local/prod. don't want to bother w/ multiple envs):
- FPBase JSON into supabase
- loop through DB, download PDB files and put into Tigris, then update respective rows with the S3 URL to file
